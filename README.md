# EnergiaDataApp
EnergiaDataApp is a tool to look into Finnish wind power and other power system data.
App is created using Streamlit and it's hosted here:

The app is using data fetched from Fingrid, ENTSO-E Transparency Platform and Finnish Meteorology Institute (FMI) open data services. 

Feel free to contact me on 𝕏, and PRs are also welcome, if you have cool ideas!

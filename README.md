# EnergiaDataApp
EnergiaDataApp is a tool to look into Finnish wind power and other power system data.
App is created using Streamlit and it's hosted here:

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://energiadata.streamlit.app)

The app is using data fetched from Fingrid, ENTSO-E Transparency Platform and Finnish Meteorology Institute (FMI) open data services. 
Due to restrictions on FMI API, older temperature data is pre-downloaded into a csv-file (old_temperatures.csv)
for performance reasons. 

The rest of the data is downloaded from the APIs while using Streamlit's own caching solution to improve performance.

Feel free to contact me on ùïè, and PRs are also welcome, if you have cool ideas!
